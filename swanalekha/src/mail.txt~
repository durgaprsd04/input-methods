Friends,
I developed a Phonetic Malayalam input method for SCIM. Using this you can type malayalam in many applications in GNOME or KDE. People who are using varamozhi, ilamozhi, mozhi-kmfl keymapping softwares currently may find this software usefull. Even though the key mapping is almost similiar to varamozhi, there are some differences. This IM does not use symbols like ^ , _ for typing. All english letters and ~ are used for mapping. Totally there are 1136 patterns coded. Some example patterns:
kaa കാ
gai ഗൈ
choo ചൂ
tee ടീ
Ne ണെ
dhR ധൃ
fo ഫൊ
nte ന്റെ
bhou ഭൌ
Suu ശൂ


sarigamapadhani സരിഗമപധനി 
zhaM or zha~ ഴം 
ponpiili or ponpeeli or ponpEli പൊന്പീലി  	
avan~ അവന്‍  	
paalakkaat or pAlakkAt പാലക്കാട്  	
axaraM or axara~ അക്ഷരം  	

I request you to try this software. To install the input method, follow the instructions in the doc folder. It is just a make , make install procedure.
For the detaild pattern mapping table refer the doc folder.

About Lalitha

As the name suggests, it is a simple to understand keymap for malayalam. It is easy to type and understand. The keymap is given along with.

After installation it can be used by adding India Malayalam-Lalitha layout in gnome-keyboard-properties

The layout is a four layer one, that is a single key maps to a maximum of 4 characters. For example,

in case of 'o',
'o' gives ൊ
'Shift+o' gives ോ
'Right Alt+o' gives ഒ
'Right Alt+Shift+o' gives ഓ

The advantage of the layout is, 
1) It retains all additional characters, like '/','[','{' etc.
2) It codes both arabic and malayalam numerals.
   i.e pressing '1' gives you 1
       combination of 'Right Alt+1' gives you ൧ 
3) The mapping is done with similarity of sounds i.e, 'f' is mapped to ഫ, and g mapped to ഗ. Some exceptions are there in   case of 'q', which map as follows:

'q' gives ൈ
'Shift+q' gives ൌ
'Right Alt+q' gives ഐ
'Right Alt+Shift+q' gives ഔ
   
4) Important additional characters like, ZWSP,ZWNJ and ZWJ are mapped as follows

   ZWSP-'Shift+x'
   ZWNJ-'Alt+\' 
   ZWJ -'Shift+v'
